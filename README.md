Product Reviews Prediction using Multinomial Naive Bayes


Introduction

Product user reviews hold an important role in the E-commerce industry. The quality of the product can be measured by reviews given by customers. A new customer can decide whether she/he buys the product or not by recommendation or review from previous customers. We can classify reviews from customers into 2 class values, "recommended" means that the products are good, and "not recommended" means that the products are bad.
Text classification aims to assign documents into one or many categories and one kind of the most useful text classification is Sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the objective to determine the writerâ€™s point of view about a particular topic, product, or service.
In this notebook, we will determine whether the product is recommended or not using sentiment analysis from customers' reviews with Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification. 
The dataset used is a dataset from Woman Clothing Review that can be accessed at ("https://github.com/YBIFoundation/ProjectHub-MachineLearning/raw/main/Women%20Clothing%20E-Commerce%20Review.csv").
